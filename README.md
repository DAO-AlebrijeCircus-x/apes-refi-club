Apes ReFi Club is an innovative platform, created for the [ETHGlobal Scaling 2023 Hackathon](https://ethglobal.com/events/scaling2023), that empowers Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT holders to measure their carbon footprint, contribute to the environment, and obtain eco-friendly NFTs.

## Project Description
Apes ReFi Club is an innovative platform that directs Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT owners towards an environmentally friendly future with their pioneering and valuable collections. In this project, the carbon footprint value of each NFT is calculated in the prestigious ApeCoin, and the owners can make their NFTs eco-friendly by paying off this debt.

Deployed on the cutting-edge Scroll network, the platform securely and decentralizedly stores NFT metadata on Polybase. By settling their carbon debts, users can mint a special environmentally friendly NFT that adds unique value to their Bored Ape NFTs. The collected ApeCoins are transferred to a dedicated DAO, where NFT holders have the right to create proposals and vote within the organization.

The goal of Apes ReFi Club is to direct the collected funds towards eco-friendly projects and sustainability initiatives worldwide, making a tangible impact on the environment and raising awareness. Our platform allows NFT owners to understand the importance of their Bored Ape collections and ApeCoin, while actively contributing to eco-friendly projects by providing resources.
